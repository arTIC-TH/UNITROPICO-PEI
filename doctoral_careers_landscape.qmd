# Introduction

This document illustrates the methodological steps for constructing a **scientific landscape** in the field of *doctoral careers early stage*. It integrates bibliometric analysis, co-occurrence of concepts, clustering, and thematic evolution.

---

# Methodological Stages

## 1. Data Collection
- Source: ISI’s Web of Science (SCI-Expanded).  
- Example: 3,000 articles (2005–2023) with keywords such as *doctoral careers*, *early career researchers*, *PhD employment*, *postdoctoral pathways*.  
- Each record includes: authors, year, keywords, cited references.

## 2. Extraction of Relevant Information
- Selected data: citations, keywords, institutions, year of publication.  
- Example of extracted relationships:  

| Article Origin       | Article Cited          | Year |
|----------------------|------------------------|------|
| A: Mobility          | B: Labor market        | 2012 |
| C: Gender gaps       | A: Mobility            | 2015 |

## 3. Construction of Citation Network
- Articles → nodes.  
- Citations → directed edges.  
- Result: a large dense graph showing intellectual connections.  

Example:  
- *PhD mobility* → cites *Labor market outcomes*.  
- *Gender gaps in doctoral careers* → cites *PhD mobility*.

## 4. Processing / Network Reduction
- Filtering: retain only relevant nodes (e.g., ≥15 citations).  
- Normalization: merging duplicates, correcting author names.  
- Example: from 3,000 to 1,200 influential articles.

## 5. Identification of Clusters
- Algorithm: Louvain, modularity, or k-means.  
- Definition: **a cluster is a community of articles or concepts strongly connected internally and weakly linked externally.**

Example of clusters in *doctoral careers early*:  
1. **Labor market outcomes** (employment, wages, overqualification).  
2. **International mobility & postdocs** (brain drain, contracts, circulation).  
3. **Gender and diversity inequalities** (gender gap, glass ceiling, diversity).  
4. **Non-academic careers** (industry, entrepreneurship, transitions).

## 6. Visualization and Comparison
- Visual map of clusters (scientific landscape).  
- Bubble size = number of articles.  
- Distance = conceptual closeness.  
- Connections show inter-cluster links (e.g., gender inequalities intersecting all topics).

---

# Co-Occurrence of Concepts

## Definition
- Frequency with which two keywords appear together in one or more articles.  
- Constructed as a network:  
  - Nodes = concepts.  
  - Edges = strength of co-occurrence.

## Example (doctoral careers early)

| Concept 1                | Concept 2              | Nº co-occurrences |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Early career researchers | Mobility              | 120               |
| Early career researchers | Gender inequality     | 90                |
| PhD labor market         | Non-academic careers  | 150               |

- Strong link between *labor market* and *non-academic careers* → many studies explore jobs outside academia.

# Discovery of New Themes

New topics can be detected by:
1. **New or rare keywords** starting to co-occur (e.g., *mental health*, *work–life balance*).  
2. **Hot papers**: highly cited recent articles.  
3. **Subclusters splitting off** from large clusters (e.g., *virtual mobility* from *international mobility*).  
4. **Rapid growth trends** in publications on a theme.

---

# The Academic Landscape

## Definition
- A **cartographic representation of knowledge** in a field.  
- Clusters = thematic regions.  
- Size = relative importance.  
- Distance = conceptual similarity.  
- Dynamics = how topics evolve.

## Analogy
- Each article = city.  
- Each citation = road.  
- Each region = cluster.  
- The full map = scientific landscape.

## Example (doctoral careers early)
- **Large region**: Labor market outcomes.  
- **Connected region**: International mobility.  
- **Emerging region**: PhD well-being & mental health.  
- **Transversal theme**: Gender inequalities (connecting all clusters).

# Conclusion

The bibliometric approach combining **citation analysis, co-occurrence, clustering, and visualization** enables the creation of an **academic landscape** for doctoral careers.  
This landscape highlights dominant topics, reveals hidden connections, and identifies **emerging research areas** such as well-being, precarity, and non-academic career pathways.
